Part I: Installation
====================

In this section, we explain the important steps to install Eyetracker on a new PC.

**Eyetracker device**

Firstly, to run the applications based on Eyetracker device, we need to install two packages respectively `here <https://sites.google.com/view/ahle-dev/project/eyetracker>`_:

1. myGaze 4.3.34.1
2. myGaze SDK 4.30.1

Then, connect the Eyetracker device to the USB 3.0 port.

Usually, these packages requires some other framework installations.

For example:
- Visual C++ 2003 Redistributable -x86
- .NET framework

**Eyetracker application**

Next, download or clone Eyetracker applications from Github.
In fact, to run Eyetracker applications, we only need the distribution versions which can be found in bin/release folders.
Copy these files somewhere in your computer for running later.
If your antivirus scans the running application, just ignore them.

Next part, we will learn how to run Eyetracker.

Here is some inline math:

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
