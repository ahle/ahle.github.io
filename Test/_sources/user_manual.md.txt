# Part II: User manual

In previous part, we learned how to install Eyetracker on a new PC.  
In this part, we explain the steps to use a Eyetracker application.

Technically, the applications communicate with Eyetracker devices via Eyetracker service.  
In other words, we should launch the Eyetracker service before Eyetracker applications.

```
$ Eyetracker/bin/release/eyetracker.exe
```

Two demo applications are implemented:

* EyetrackerDemo: a window form application based on Eyetracker
* EyetrackerWebDemo: a web version of EyetrackerDemo

```
$ EyetrackerDemo/bin/release/eyetracker.exe
```
